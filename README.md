Thank you for checking out The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack!

IMPORTANT NOTE: This version of the modpack was updated due to the new version of ARCropolis that was released.
Unfortunately, this means that many fake one-slot mods from the old version of my modpack are unusable, thus I had to make this new version.
You can still find the old version here: https://github.com/WuBoytH/WuBoyUltimateModpack-OLD

This version of the modpack also has no need for the "Skin Fixes" folder from the previous version.

Installation:
Simply drag all of the files (except for README.md and Final Kill Screen Preview.png) into the root of your SD card, and you should be ready to go!

If you have a previous version of the modpack installed, please delete the following folders before installing anew:
 - SD:\ultimate\mods\The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack
 - SD:\ultimate\mods\The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack Music
 - SD:\ultimate\mods\The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack Optionals
You also need to install ARCropolis, which you can find here: https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/releases/tag/v0.9.6

Notes:

All the changes found in the WuBoy Ultimate Modpack can be found here:

If you have installed a previous version of the modpack, you may still have a folder called:
 - SD:\atmosphere\contents\01006A800016E000\romfs\arc
I have moved those files over to SD:\ultimate\mods\Skin Fixes
Please delete the first folder from your SD card, as you will not need it anymore.

You can choose not to use this, but many skins will look wrong due to how Smash Ultimate loads files.
Hopefully, in the future, this kind of fix will be unneccessary and can be removed from the modpack, my apologies for the inconvenience!

The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack Optionals includes:
 - text edits throughout menus, Star Fox's final smash subtitles, and Hero's spell list, for the fun of it =)
 - "THE WHEEL OF FATE IS TURNING" from BlazBlue Centralfiction, when the announcer says "READY" in a battle arena
 - a yellow and green kill-screen background when you deal a finishing blow, you can preview it with "Final Kill Screen Preview.png"
 - an iDubbbz "Hey!" when you get a parry

If you do not wish to use any of these, feel free to delete "The WuBoy Modpack Optionals" from SD:\ultimate\mods\.
If you wish to keep only some of these, the files are as follows:

 - Text edits: SD:\ultimate\mods\The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack Optionals\ui\message\msg_melee.msbt and msg_menu.msbt
 - "THE WHEEL OF FATE IS TURNING": SD:\ultimate\mods\The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack Optionals\sound\bank\narration\vc_narration_menu.nus3audio
 - iDubbbz "Hey!" parry: SD:\ultimate\mods\The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack Optionals\sound\bank\common\se_common.nus3audio
 - the final kill screen: SD:\ultimate\mods\The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack Optionals\effect\system\common\ef_common.eff
 - Special note for the kill screen: If it does not show up for you, please delete the ef_common.eff file in
 - SD:\ultimate\mods\The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack\effect\system\common\, as they have a tendency to overwrite each other.

Special Thanks:
 - @borboracci for helping make music extensions
 - All of those who worked on ARCropolis and Ultimate Mod Manager for helping me spark the idea to make a modpack
 - KGP and ShoopdaWooper for convincing me to make a Smash 4 modpack all those years ago
 - The Scarlet Smash community for being cool ;)

ISSUES/BUGS:

 - Steve's custom Final Smash video has a gap in the audio, due to how his sound effects work.
 - Certain skins may still have issues with their textures, as I have not added their skin fixes yet.
 - I don't have announcer calls ready for every character yet, so some characters may have mis-matched announcer calls. This will be fixed in due time.

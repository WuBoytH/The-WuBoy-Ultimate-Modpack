Thank you for checking out The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack! Full modpack last updated 3/16/21.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This version of the modpack was updated due to the new version of ARCropolis that was released.
Unfortunately, this means that many fake one-slot mods from the old version of my modpack are unusable, thus I had to make this new version.
[You can still find the old version here.](https://github.com/WuBoytH/WuBoyUltimateModpack-OLD)

Another note, you will now see an Updates folder, which will hold all of the updated files since the previous version.
I will also be putting the date of the previous full version on the top of the README, so you know what to download.
I will merge the updates with the rest of the modpack after enough updates.

Installation:
[Grab the lastest ARCropolis from here.](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/)
Drag all of the files (except for README.md and Final Kill Screen Preview.png) into the following directory:
 - SD:\ultimate\mods\

If you have a previous version of the modpack installed, please delete the following folders before installing anew:
 - SD:\ultimate\mods\The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack
 - SD:\ultimate\mods\The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack Music
 - SD:\ultimate\mods\The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack Optionals

The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack Optionals includes:
 - text edits throughout menus, Star Fox's final smash subtitles, and Hero's spell list, for the fun of it =)
 - "THE WHEEL OF FATE IS TURNING" from BlazBlue Centralfiction, when the announcer says "READY" in a battle arena
 - an iDubbbz "Hey!" when you get a parry

If you do not wish to use any of these, feel free to delete "The WuBoy Modpack Optionals" from SD:\ultimate\mods\.
If you wish to keep only some of these, the files are as follows:

 - Text edits: The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack Optionals\ui\message\msg_melee.msbt and msg_menu.msbt
 - "THE WHEEL OF FATE IS TURNING": The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack Optionals\sound\bank\narration\vc_narration_menu.nus3audio
 - iDubbbz "Hey!" parry: The WuBoy Ultimate Modpack Optionals\sound\bank\common\se_common.nus3audio

Special Thanks:
 - @borboracci for helping make music extensions
 - All of those who worked on ARCropolis and Ultimate Mod Manager for helping me spark the idea to make a modpack
 - KGP and ShoopdaWooper for convincing me to make a Smash 4 modpack all those years ago
 - The Scarlet Smash community for being cool ;)

ISSUES/BUGS:

 - Steve's custom Final Smash video has a gap in the audio, due to how his sound effects work.
 - I don't have announcer calls ready for every character yet, so some characters may have mis-matched announcer calls. This will be fixed in due time.
